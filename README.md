### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name it's Mitsuha Kitsune and I'm software developer.
Iâ€™m currently working on [LeagueTails](https://leaguetails.com/), a dedicated community for League of Legends and [Never it's over Network](https://neveritsover.com/), a network and gamming community for other games and platforms.

On my free time, I love contribute with opensource, so isn't rare see my name on other projects than mine.
